Therefore, instead of a single move, the algorithm should consider several moves ahead. For every possible move, it should consider every possible response from the other player, and then every possible subsequent move, and so on. All of these possibilities can be organized in a tree. As you can imagine, the number of possbilities grows exponentially as the algorithm attempts to think many moves ahead ... and so does the computational cost. \n",
